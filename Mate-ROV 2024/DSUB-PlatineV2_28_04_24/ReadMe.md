# **ROV DSUB 2024**

## **Overview**  
This PCB was designed for an underwater ROV to handle power distribution and signal management between sensors, thrusters, and control electronics. It plays a crucial role in ensuring reliable communication and power delivery in a compact, underwater-compatible design.  

## **Features**  
- **Thruster Compatibility**: Supports **Blue Robotics T200/T500 thrusters**  
- **Integrated Microcontroller**: Facilitates signal processing and communication  
- **Raspberry Pi Interface**: Designed for seamless integration with Raspberry Pi-based control systems  
- **Compact & Robust Design**: Optimized for underwater housing with improved power efficiency  

## **Files Included**  
- **Schematics**: Altium project files  
- **PCB Layout**: Altium design files  
- **Photos**: Real-life images of the assembled PCB in operation  

## **Challenges & Solutions**  
- **Power Distribution Issue**: The first DSUB version encountered problems with heat from the power distribution. In response, power distribution now comes externally. 
- **Environmental Considerations**: The design was refined to withstand underwater conditions, ensuring stable operation in a high-humidity environment.
